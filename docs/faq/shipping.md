### Where do you ship from?

All of our items are shipped from Durham, NC, USA.

### Do you ship internationally?

Yes, we do ship internationally.

+ Note that international shipping takes approximately 7-28 days depending on the destination. Covid also creates an additional need for timeframe flexibility.
+ International shipments may be subject to customs fees, import duties, and taxes, which are the responsibility of the buyer.
+ It is recommended that you leave Route Shipping Protection on during checkout due to the frequency of delivery issues for international packages with postal services.
    + Do note that claims must be filed within 60 days of the order and within 30 days of last tracking update!
+ NOTE: Recently we have stopped shipping to Russia due to challenges with getting our packages to people and issues with customs. However, you are welcome to make use of a proxy address and bounce your package off that address to get it to you in Russia.

### Is there a tracking number for packages?

Yes, each package will have a tracking number that will automatically be emailed to you when we ship.

+ **NOTE: We do not have any additional information about packages other than what you see with the tracking number that is sent to you.**

### When will my order ship?

Your order will be shipped within 3-4 business days. We operate Monday through Friday, except for holidays. Typically, orders are filled every day we operate and are shipped out the same day it has been packed.

### My package was marked as delivered but I did not receive it, what should I do?

For people in the U.S. using USPS, sometimes, USPS will mark a package as delivered but will end up delivering the next day instead, or the package was misdelivered to a neighbor. We recommend that you contact USPS directly by going to https://usps.force.com/emailus/s/package-inquiry. Someone from the post office should then be able to look into the issue and contact you. Otherwise, you can also file a claim with Route for the missing package here: https://claims.route.com/

Please wait at least 3-4 business days before contacting us.

**NOTE:** We do not have any additional information about packages other than what you see in the tracking information.

### What should I do if I'm missing items or received the wrong items in my package?

Email us at shop@keeb.io with your order number (starts with `KB-`), a picture of the packing slip, and a list of what's missing, and we'll get you'll sorted out.
