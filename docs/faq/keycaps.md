title: Recommended Keycaps
---

While we don't sell keycaps here at Keebio other than an [ortho compatibility kit](https://keeb.io/products/gmk-n9-ortholinear-add-on-kit), we do have some vendors that we recommend.

A fun part of the mechanical keyboard community is that we're found all over the world. You can support folks from all over with your purchases, if you like!
