### How do you pronounce "Keebio"?

It's just one word, Keebio (KEE-bee-oh).

Not Keeb-dot-i-o, that's just the easy way to remember the website URL.

### What's this tiny 19.05mm x 38.1mm PCB that came with my order?

That's a keychain PCB that you can solder a switch to (MX/Alps/Choc) and show off to your friends.
