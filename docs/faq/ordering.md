### I need to add more items to an order I've already placed that hasn't shipped yet, what can I do?

Contact us with a detailed list of what items you'd like to add. It'd be helpful if you took a screenshot of the items in the cart. That way, we can use the image with your list to modify your order and invoice you for the difference.

### Can I pre-order items or can I place an order for some parts and have you hold them?

Sorry, we do not do pre-orders for items or order holds due to logistical reasons.

### Do you accept PayPal?

No, we no longer accept PayPal. PayPal has business practices and policies that we do not agree with, such as [keeping the 3% transaction fee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPXhzgC2ODs) [on refunds](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#refunds-reversals-chargebacks). Additionally, credit cards provide better buyer protection and safety features anyway compared to what PayPal offers, if that is your concern. Also, we offer other good payment alternatives such as Apple Pay, Amazon Pay, and Google Pay.
