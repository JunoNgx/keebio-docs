title: Standard for Build Guides
---

To create a keyboard build guide, follow the instructions below. Make note of any special hardware that specific build needs that may make it different from other builds.

To write a build guide for a keyboard please answer the questions below. Create a copy of this document, then write out answers to the questions in a clear & warm manner. Omit any questions that don’t apply to the keyboard build you are making a guide for.

:::note 
Be sure to make your writing welcoming and warm. Use vocabulary that states things in a helpful and friendly manner. You're building a keyboard with a friend, excited to make something new! With a side dish of poptart cat.

## Build Compatibility

### Is this build similar to other builds?

* List the other builds this is similar to: "Looks like you're working on the Iris! This build is similar to these other builds: ... So be sure to choose beforehand what you're most excited to see in front of your computer screen."

####  Watch out for...

* List things someone making this build should be careful of/aware of: “Read me first! Before you start, consider if you’d like to make these optional additions (and/or make a note of things a user needs to be careful of): [list]. It works to choose otherwise, but these choices are open to you if you’re into them!”

## Videos of Builds & Blogs

**Name of YouTuber in Bold** Title of video here.

List other blogs and websites that may include pointers or display support for the builds.

## Parts List

1. Have an image that showcases every item *needed* for the build. If there are optional items, include those in a separate image.
2. List all the items included from required items starting at the top of the list and otional items listed and labeled "optional" after required items.

## Build Steps Summary

List all the main points of the build, have *optional* items noted.

1. The first step for all the sets is going to be a recommendation for Flashing Firmware.
2. Other things will happen in different sequences

## Flashing Firmware

Provide a brief explanation and also direct readers to our ultimate flashing page. It's coming soon!

## Prepare Components

Advise the reader of helpful prep so they can proceed to begin the build. For example, if a user would be helped to fold diodes at this phase, instruct them to do so: “You’ll find the following steps easier if you fold diodes first. Hop to that, and then hop to the next step.”

## Solder Components

Advise the reader if certain things need to be soldered within a sequence or not. 
List *optional* soldering after *required* soldering (provided they don't hinder the other).
+ If there are any things missing from the build or needed workarounds, include them prior to the step where the issue might arise in the build

## Optional but needed in a certain sequence

Advise the reader of optional additions that can be made, but place them within the guide where it would be best handled.

## Solder Switches

Have any cautions about final soldering precede this section for the reader.

## Assembly

Following soldering parts together, if there is a specific sequence for the assembly of the items, number each item distinctly and clearly.

## Programming

As in builds like the Quefrency Rev. 2, programming is required before concluding the build. 

## Rejoice!

You have a brand-new mechanical keyboard to aid your quest of computer usage with less strain on yours wrists in style!
