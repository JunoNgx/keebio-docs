title: Sinc Rev. 3 Hotswap Build Guide
---

A build guide for the Sinc Rev. 3 is in progress, but due to the similarity of the Sinc Rev. 3 to the Quefrency Rev. 4-5, see the build guide for that instead: [Quefrency Rev. 4-5 Hotswap Build Guide](quefrency-hotswap-build-guide.md)

## ANSI to ISO Enter Hotswap Conversion

Because of the limitations of where the hotswap sockets could be placed, only the ANSI Enter layout is supported out of the box.

To convert the right half of the board to support ISO Enter, you'll need to desolder 2 of the hotswap sockets and relocated them to the appropriate locations for ISO Enter support.

### Tools Needed

- Soldering iron
- Solder
- Tweezers or small flathead screwdriver

### Desolder Sockets

Below is the location of the two sockets that will need to be moved.

#### Step 1 - Add solder to sockets

The first thing you'll need to do is add solder to both pins of the socket. This will make the socket easier to desolder, as the temperature needed to melt the solder on the socket will be less, which makes it easier to work with. Be careful to not touch the iron to the plastic of the socket, but it's not a big deal if it accidentally happens.

#### Step 2 - Heat pads and remove sockets

You'll want to be careful here and not use too much force when removing the socket, as you might damage the pads. 

### Resolder Sockets

Here's where the desoldered sockets should be moved to:

### Update Layout
