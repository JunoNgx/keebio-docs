title: Remapping/Reprogramming your Keyboard
---

If you'd like to change what each key on your keyboard does, this process is called remapping, as you're changing what's called a keymap on your board. There are a few ways this can be done, each with its pros and cons and also varying degree of of difficulty.

## What is QMK?

First of all, every board at [Keebio](https://keeb.io) is compatible with [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm) and are all pre-flashed with a [default QMK Firmware and keymap](default-keymaps.md). [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm) is an open-source keyboard firmware, and most keyboards within the mechanical keyboard community use QMK. QMK also encompasses a suite of other tools, such as [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/) and [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox).

QMK Firmware has a lots of features, like supporting multiple layers, macros, Mod-Tap, mouse keys, split keyboards, backlighting, RGB, etc., which makes is a popular choice for hobbyists. There are alternative keyboard firmwares out there, but these are not officially supported by Keebio.

## Remapping Options

There are 3 main options for changing your board's keymap, ordered from least difficult to most difficult to use:

- VIA Configurator
